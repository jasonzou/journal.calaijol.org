# journal.calaijol.org
The OJS system on journal.calaijol.org. This system is using OJS-Theme developed by George Mason University. 
But the site is under construction. There are more changes, plugins, and add-on tools that may be used for the site.
For example, this site (http://jlsc-pub.org/) will be a good example.
